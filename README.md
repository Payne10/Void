void

void is a comprehensive networking tool written in Go designed to sit between your router and the rest of your internal LAN. It captures and analyzes all network traffic, creating a visual map of the network and allowing for packet manipulation, firewall management, and machine learning-based traffic analysis.
Features

    Network Mapping: Automatically discovers and maps all devices on the network.
    Packet Capturing: Captures and duplicates all network packets in real-time.
    Packet Manipulation: Allows modification and filtering of network packets.
    Visualization: Provides a graphical representation of the network.
    Firewall Management: Implements machine learning-based firewall rules.
    Protocol Analysis: Supports deep packet inspection and protocol analysis.
    Scalability: Optimized for high throughput and large networks.

Installation
Prerequisites

    Go 1.18 or higher
    libpcap library (for packet capturing)

Clone the Repository

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/void.git
cd void

Install Dependencies

bash

go mod download

Build

bash

go build -o void cmd/main.go

Usage
Running the Application

To start the application, simply run:

bash

sudo ./void

    Note: sudo is required to capture network packets.

Network Mapping

Upon starting, void will automatically create a visual map of the network using ARP requests and responses. The map can be accessed via a web-based interface provided by the application.
Packet Capturing and Manipulation

void will capture all packets on the specified network interface. Packet duplication and manipulation rules can be configured in the configuration file.
Machine Learning Integration

void integrates machine learning models for traffic analysis and firewall management. Models can be trained on custom datasets and loaded into the application.
Configuration

The configuration file config.yaml allows customization of various aspects of the application:

yaml

network:
  interface: eth0
  promiscuous: true

visualization:
  enabled: true
  output: ./network_map.png

firewall:
  ml_model: ./models/firewall_model.h5

logging:
  level: info
  output: ./logs/void.log
